Priors can tricky set, techniques choosing good priors outside scope tutorial. can see priors need set particular model using get_default_priors() function. defaults almost always changed. priors object gives list priors parameters edge model: edge weights, additional fixed effects, random effect parameters. prior_check() function can used plot prior distributions, ’ll use check ’re happy priors:  priors encode prior beliefs likely values parameters. demonstration purposes let’s say expect edge weights concentrated lower, towards zero. can modify priors edge weight like :  Depending biology, might like want see. Now ’ve set priors ’re happy , can fit edge model using bison_model() function. one main functions bisonR package lot functionality. main thing worry define edge weight model formula. formula designed familar used lm, lme4, brms, regression packages. main difference need include measure observation effort get accurate estimates edge weight uncertainty. bisonR, left hand side ~ describes sampling data, uses (event | duration) notation. notation, event corresponds name column dataframe represents measure social events, 1 0 binary model, frequencies 0, 1, 2, … count model. using unaggregated dataframe, duration corresponds durations observation. case fixed, depend data hand. right hand side ~ describes predictors associated social events. standard BISoN model primarily edge weight use build network, can also include additional effects age, sex, even observation-level factors location, time day, weather, name .
