Priors can tricky set, techniques choosing good priors outside scope tutorial, see resources help choosing priors BISoN. recommend retrieving default priors bisonR using get_default_priors() function get correct set default priors edge weight model. list shows priors set “fixed effect” parameters: edge weights additional fixed effects included edge weight model; “random effect” parameters: additional random effects included edge weight model. Imagine decide normal distribution mean zero standard deviation 1 appropriate fixed effects, ’d prefer standard deviation 2, can change using following code: Now ’ve set priors ’re happy , can fit edge model using edge_model() function. one main functions bisonR package lot functionality. main thing worry define edge weight model formula. formula designed familar used lm, lme4, brms, regression packages. main difference need include measure sampling intensity get accurate estimates edge weight uncertainty. bisonR, left hand side ~ describes sampling data, uses (event | duration) notation. notation, event corresponds name column dataframe represents measure social events, 1 0 binary model, frequencies 0, 1, 2, … count model. using unaggregated dataframe, duration corresponds durations observation. case fixed, depend data hand. right hand side ~ describes predictors associated social events. standard BISoN model primarily edge weight use build network, can also include additional effects age, sex, even observation-level factors location, time day, weather, name . Including additional effects change interpretation edge weights, useful interested social network factors controlled .

Usually ’s major problem, edge_model() function triggered warning messages . even everything silent, ’s still worth checking traceplots check MCMC chains converged. chains well-mixed look something like fuzzy caterpillar. can check using plot_trace() function:  ’re satisfied MCMC algorithm done job properly, ’s time see true model.
