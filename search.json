Imagine decide normal distribution mean zero standard deviation 1 appropriate fixed effects, ’d prefer standard deviation 2, can change using following code: Now ’ve set priors ’re happy , can fit edge model using edge_model() function. one main functions bisonR package lot functionality. main thing worry define edge weight model formula. formula designed familar used lm, lme4, brms, regression packages. main difference need include measure sampling intensity get accurate estimates edge weight uncertainty. bisonR, left hand side ~ describes sampling data, uses (event | duration) notation. notation, event corresponds name column dataframe represents measure social events, 1 0 binary model, frequencies 0, 1, 2, … count model. using unaggregated dataframe, duration corresponds durations observation. case fixed, depend data hand. right hand side ~ describes predictors associated social events. standard BISoN model primarily edge weight use build network, can also include additional effects age, sex, even observation-level factors location, time day, weather, name .
