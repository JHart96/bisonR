Priors can tricky set, techniques choosing good priors outside scope tutorial, see resources help choosing priors BISoN. recommend retrieving default priors bisonR using get_default_priors() function get correct set default priors edge weight model. list shows priors set “fixed effect” parameters: edge weights additional fixed effects included edge weight model; “random effect” parameters: additional random effects included edge weight model. Imagine decide normal distribution mean zero standard deviation 1 appropriate fixed effects, ’d prefer standard deviation 2, can change using following code: Now ’ve set priors ’re happy , can fit edge model using edge_model() function. one main functions bisonR package lot functionality. main thing worry define edge weight model formula. formula designed familar used lm, lme4, brms, regression packages. main difference need include measure sampling intensity get accurate estimates edge weight uncertainty. bisonR, left hand side ~ describes sampling data, uses (event | duration) notation. notation, event corresponds name column dataframe represents measure social events, 1 0 binary model, frequencies 0, 1, 2, … count model. using unaggregated dataframe, duration corresponds durations observation. case fixed, depend data hand. right hand side ~ describes predictors associated social events. standard BISoN model primarily edge weight use build network, can also include additional effects age, sex, even observation-level factors location, time day, weather, name . Including additional effects change interpretation edge weights, useful interested social network factors controlled . Note edge weights don’t need included, use bisonR estimate generative effects network. example ’ll keep things simple just use edge weight predictor. done using dyad(node_1_id, node_2_id) notation. node_1_id node_2_id represent nodes corresponding individual network, need stored factors dataframe. don’t need IDs, individual names, long ’re stored factors. Now understand basics formula notation, can now fit edge weight model: Depending dataset can take anywhere tenths second several hours. particular large dataset observation-level predictors, ’s probably good idea use aggregated version model observations per dyad collapsed single row. speed model fitting considerably. model fitted, need check MCMC algorithm behaved correctly. Usually ’s major problem, edge_model() function triggered warning messages . even everything silent, ’s still worth checking traceplots check MCMC chains converged. chains well-mixed look something like fuzzy caterpillar. can check using plot_trace() function:  ’re satisfied MCMC algorithm done job properly, ’s time see true model. One way , among many others, check predictions fitted model real data. can done using plot_predictions() function. real data within ensemble predictions model, little faith model capturing least important properties data. statistical model implies range predictions can extract multiple draws, number can set using num_draws argument.  predictions model shown blue real data shown black. Ideally blue lines distributed around black line, indicating real data among possible predictions model. Now ’ve conducted two basic diagnostic checks edge weight model, can start trust ’s telling us. see summary edge weights credible intervals, can use summary() function: can hard get intuitive idea ’s going looking summary table, can useful visualise network . plot_network() function BISoN edge weight models, uncertainty shown edge weights.
